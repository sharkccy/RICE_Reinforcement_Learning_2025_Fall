# RICE Reinforcement Learning 2025 Fall

Name: Chung-Yu (Vincent) Chang (張仲瑜)

## Introduction:
This repository contains the projects for the RICE Reinforcement Learning course in 2025 Fall.

Multiple classical reinforcement learning algorithms are involved, including
- Value Iteration
- Policy Iteration
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- REINFORCE with and without Baseline
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- imitation learning via Behavioral Cloning

I was a master student of computer science when taking this course.
