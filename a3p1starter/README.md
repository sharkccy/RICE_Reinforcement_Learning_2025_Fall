# Assignment 3, Part 1

## Objective
This assignment uses the [Frozen Lake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment from [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). Your task is to compute the optimal policy for an agent operating in this environment, by implementing
- policy evaluation,
- value iteration, and
- policy iteration algorithms.

## Files Provided 

* `submission.py` – Starter code.
* `helper.py` – Helper functions.
* `main.py` – Script to train and visualize your agent.
* `requirements.txt` – Dependencies for the assignment's starter code.
* `README.md` - This file.

## Implementation Requirements  

Complete the missing code in `submission.py`.

## Notes
- Do not make changes to the names of given files, functions, or classes.
- Use **Python 3.9 or 3.10**. Your code should work with the package versions
    provided in the `requirements.txt` file.
- To receive credit, please ensure that your code terminates within 20 minutes
    when evaluated using the Gradescope autograder.
    Efficient solutions take much less time.

## Submission

- You only need to submit the **`submission.py`** file to Gradescope.
- Do **not** zip the entire project or rename the file.
    The autograder will look specifically for `submission.py`.

## Autograder Workflow
The autograder will:
1. Import your implementation.
2. Evaluate the implemented algorithms.
3. Award credits based on the accuracy of computed policy and values.
